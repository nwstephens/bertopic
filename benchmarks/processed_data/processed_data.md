# Processed Data

### Data Reloading

This step is helpful when data loading and preprocessing has happened once, and we do not want to relaod the data again.
- There are some data cleaning steps like removal of text which only consist of numbers or duplicate text, but it should be customized based on dataset
- You can avoid this step during the first run as all the dataset variables point to right dataset

This helps us in reading data from the processed folder so that we can skip data loading and preprocessing in future runs.
